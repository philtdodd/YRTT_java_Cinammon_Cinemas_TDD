# YRTT_java_Cinammon_Cinemas_TDD

- Just started with a basic class that let me setup a theatre seats and made the test pas.
- Next added test to check the output of the class matches what we have asked the class to do.
- Next added BookSeats, this made a note of a customer number then assigned seats to that customer as 
the bookings are made
- Finally added main to loop until the seasts are full and output the customer orders

Given more tiume on this task I would let further bookings be made until the whole screen was booked. Also add the 
ability to get one customers seats on a single row rather than spanning rows, unless they orders more than the number
of seats in a row
